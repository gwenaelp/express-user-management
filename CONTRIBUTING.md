# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/gwenaelp/express-user-management/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you can write doc and tests for what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes would be better with a descriptive and longer text.

The use of commitizen is encouraged, and commit messages should respect the in-place standard setup. If you are not sure on how to write commit message, running `npx git-cz` instead of `git commit` should help you.

## Coding conventions

Code conventions are described in the `.editorconfig` file. Your editor might have a plugin to help you with it.
The project uses :
- two spaces indentation
- semicolons at the end of instructions

Thanks,
Gwenael Pluchon
